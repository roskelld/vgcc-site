                Great video games take you into fantasy worlds where anything is possible, but building them isn't magic. The steps to designing and developing a game is grounded in to a process of knowing the limitations of technology, picking the right challenges to face, being open minded to critic and ready to be challenged.

                        If there's a short way to sell our value then it's: We've spent a combined near 40 year period designing, developing and releasing video games; we've seen the pitfalls, experienced the challenges, suffered the lows, and celebrated the highs of it all.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Whilst we're not done yet in our journey to create games on current and future platforms, we found ourselves thinking about ways in which we can help others with the knowledge and experiences we have.

                        Our conclusion was to set up a service at the intersection of developers and funding. Games need funding to be made, but how do investors differentiate between great and not so great ideas? We believe that we can offer help there by looking at those ideas from our perspective as developers, presenting our thoughts in plain and bullsh<span class="red-text">*</span>t free language.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Whether you're a small investor or part of a large group, our approach is to work with you in a respectable and valued way, by listening to your process and communicating our findings crisply and clearly.

                        <p class="left-align small-text">His work on TheHunter game, named as an important part of the parent companies' 2018 acquisition - set in granite the core foundations of the title. 10 years since launch it has flourished, as many other online games wilted.</p>
                        <p class="left-align small-text">His 2016 title, Smash City, will always be a source of joy. With absolute autonomy on the project from an idea all his own - he oversaw a tiny team to create a multi-million revenue game created in just 8 weeks.</p>
                        <p class="left-align small-text">Across these projects and more, Troy has identified a passion in discerning the what, when, and who of truly incredible game development prospects.</p>
